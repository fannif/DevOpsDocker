The command I used to start the process was:
sudo docker run -it --name ubu-it ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://;'

The commands I used to fix the ensuing problem (that curl was not installed):
sudo docker exec -it ubu-it bash
apt update
apt install curl
exit

And then the working command was:
sudo docker exec -it ubu-it sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
