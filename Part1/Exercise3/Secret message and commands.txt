Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'

The commands I gave were:
sudo docker run -d devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
sudo docker ps -a (To find the name of the container, which was eloquent_bose)
sudo docker exec -it eloquent_bose bash
tail -f ./text.log
