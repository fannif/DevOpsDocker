The password was "basics" and the secret message was "This is the secret message.

I found the password by going to the dockerhub website and searching for pull_exercise.
From there I found the link to the GitHub repository with the dockerfile and password in it.

I used the commands:

$ sudo docker pull devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
