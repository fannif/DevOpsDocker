I used the web-server image built in exercise 1.7. The commands I used were:

$ sudo docker build . -t web-server (to build the image from the 1.7 dockerfile)

$ sudo docker run -p 3000:8080 web-server (to run it)

After this, the server was running and I could visit localhost:3000 in a browser to see the message {"message":"You connected to the following path: /","path":"/"}.
